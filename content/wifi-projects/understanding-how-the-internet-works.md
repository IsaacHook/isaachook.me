To understand exactly what I can do with the ESP8266 or any other WIFI module I wanted to get a clearer
picture of how the Internet actually works.  At the moment, there are a bunch of terms which I only have 
a fuzzy understanding of (web server, web client, DNS, CNAME, HTTP...) and I'm not sure how all the components of 
the Internet fit together (what actually is a modem/router?).

In writing this I hope to answer:  

- At a high level how does the Internet actually work?
- If the Internet was rebuilt from scratch today, what would be the simplest example of this? Two computers over one wire?
- How do all the components fit together?
- What are the components?
- Get an understanding of all the terminology
- Work out:
    - Could I host an external website on a WIFI module?
    - If I connected the WIFI module to a WIFI network what are the ways I can communicate with other computers on that network?
    - If I wanted to turn a module into a simple Internet connected switch, 
        what would be the best way to do this so that setup is super simple and can be accessed anywhere?
