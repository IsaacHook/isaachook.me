1. Register domain name (I used godaddy)
2. Register for Amazon Web Services
3. Some other complicated stuff to setup AWS


Once you have a domain name you need to find yourself a website template and a way to upload content.

Most common way of doing this would be to use a wordpress website.
Wordpress is a CMS which allows you to easily upload content, however this means you would have to host the wordpress CMS somewhere.  

Alternatively, you could find a way of generating static websites and host them on AWS S3.

4. Install hugo
5. Download hugo template
6. Write posts
7. Generate public folder to be uploaded
8. Upload public folder to AWS
